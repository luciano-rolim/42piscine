# Piscine
- This repository contains the projects of my first month at 42 School (at the school, we call this intro month the "Piscine").
- Since it was my first time coding in C, some codes are not 100% optimized.
- Most functions have a commented int main below them. They are helpful to test each function separately.
- Exercise subjects are availale on the folder "Subjects"
